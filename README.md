## EcoSense adapter for ioBroker

Reads the radon concentration of **EcoSense EcoQube** radon monitors from the EcoSense cloud.

Manufacturer / device: [EcoSense EcoQube](https://ecosense.io/products/ecoqube)

Radon is a radioactive, odourless gas and the second most common cause of lung cancer. With this adapter
you can use the EcoQube measurements in ioBroker – for charts, notifications or to switch a fan.

> **Note:** EcoSense does not offer an official, documented API. The adapter uses the same cloud
> interface as the EcoQube app. If EcoSense changes it, the adapter may stop working until it is updated.

### Requirements

- An EcoQube that is connected to Wi-Fi and shows values in the EcoQube app
- The e-mail address and password of your EcoSense account (as used in the app)
- Accounts with two-factor authentication are not supported

### Configuration

| Setting                    | Description                                                        | Default |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| E-mail / Password          | Login of the EcoQube app. The password is stored encrypted.        | –       |
| Polling interval           | Minutes between two cloud requests (minimum 5)                     | 10      |
| Warning threshold (orange) | From this value `alertLevel` becomes 1 (WHO recommendation)        | 100     |
| Alarm threshold (red)      | From this value `alertLevel` becomes 2 (German reference value)    | 300     |

The EcoQube itself only uploads a new value about every 10 minutes, so a shorter interval does not give newer data.

### States

For every EcoQube a device named after its serial number is created (display name = name from the app):

| State                       | Type    | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<serial>.radon`            | number  | Radon concentration in Bq/m³ (`null` while the device warms up) |
| `<serial>.radonPci`         | number  | Radon concentration in pCi/L                                    |
| `<serial>.alertLevel`       | number  | 0 = green, 1 = orange, 2 = red (based on your thresholds)       |
| `<serial>.alertText`        | string  | `green`, `orange` or `red`                                      |
| `<serial>.lastMeasurement`  | number  | Time of the last measurement uploaded by the device             |
| `<serial>.online`           | boolean | Device uploaded within the last 3 upload periods (~30 min)      |
| `<serial>.firmware`         | string  | Firmware version                                                |
| `<serial>.json`             | string  | Device data as JSON (without personal data)                     |
| `<serial>.raw.*`            | mixed   | Every other simple field the cloud delivers, unchanged          |
| `info.connection`           | boolean | Last cloud request was successful                               |
| `info.lastPoll`             | number  | Timestamp of the last successful request                        |

**Privacy:** the cloud also returns the account e-mail, your public IP address, the Wi-Fi name and the
location entered in the app. The adapter drops these fields – they are never written to states or logs.

### Testing the cloud access without ioBroker

```bash
npm install
ECOSENSE_EMAIL="you@example.com" ECOSENSE_PASSWORD="secret" npm run check-api
```

The script logs in, lists every field the API returns and prints the raw JSON without personal data.
Please attach this output when you open an issue about missing values.
